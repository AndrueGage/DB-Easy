### Usage:

A user can easily schedule dates for boarding, grooming, and training. Dog Boarding Ez makes it easy to schedule by saving user and dog data. This ensures that a user will only have to enter their info the first time. Dog Boarding Ez also helps dog business owners see incoming boarding, training, and grooming date requests and accept or deny them as they would like. It also gives the owner a way to see all scheduled appointments and the information on the dogs for those appointments.
