### How to Install:

Create a .env file. open the mysql command shell. SOURCE the schema.sql file in the db folder. Then npm run seed in the terminal. Last, use command npm start to start the server.


### Usage:

A user can easily schedule dates for boarding, grooming, and training. Dog Boarding Ez makes it easy to schedule by saving user and dog data. This ensures that a user will only have to enter their info the first time. Dog Boarding Ez also helps dog business owners see incoming boarding, training, and grooming date requests and accept or deny them as they would like. It also gives the owner a way to see all scheduled appointments and the information on the dogs for those appointments.
